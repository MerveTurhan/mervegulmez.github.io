In this paper, a deep neural network for Generalized frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) symbol detection and demodulation is considered. A new receiver model, including classical linear detector based coarse detection and deep neural network-based fine detection, is proposed in order to improve the error performance of the system. It has been demonstrated that the proposed deep neural network-based detection and demodulation scheme provides better bit error rate (BER) performance with respect to classical linear detectors.
