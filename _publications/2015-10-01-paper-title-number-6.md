<!-- The use of unsafe programming languages still remains one of the
major root causes of software vulnerabilities. Although well-known
defenses that detect and mitigate memory-safety related issues exist,
they donâ€™t address the challenge of software resilience, i.e., whether
a system under attack can continue to carry out its function when
subjected to malicious input. We propose secure rollback of isolated domains as an efficient and secure method of improving the
resilience of software targeted by run-time attacks. We show the
practicability of our methodology by realizing a software library for
Secure Domain Rollback (SDRoB) and demonstrate how SDRoB
can be applied to real-world software -->
