I am a security researcher at Ericsson and PhD Student at KU Leuven. 

I am a part of [5GhOST](https://5ghosts.eu/) project funded by the EU involving [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) and [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). 

I have been studing the strong isolation mechanism nowadays. I hope I will come up with so nice papers soonish. Stay Tuned!
