I am a security researcher at Ericsson and PhD Student at KU Leuven. 

I am a part of [5GhOST](https://5ghosts.eu/) project funded by the EU involving [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) and [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). 

I am interested in system security, improving software resilience, and environmental sustainability.  

2024 

  * I have been working on CHERI for about a year. It has been a long and educational project for me. I worked on extending the qemu simulator, llvm compiler, Flute core, and CheriFreertos. The preprint for "[Mon CHÃˆRI â™¡ Adapting Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC with Conditional Capabilities](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08663)" is now available here. 

  * I hosted Sacha Ruchlejmer from Phelma University as a master's thesis student. He worked on adapting the secure and rewind discard project to the Arm Morello Board at Ericsson Research. He successfully defended his thesis and graduated from Phelma University; Congrats, Sacha ðŸŽ‰ You can read his thesis -> [Secure Rewind and Discard on Arm Morello](https://secure-rewind-and-discard.github.io/files/Master_Thesis___Secure_Rewind_on_Discard_on_ARM_Morello.pdf).

  * Our paper, "[System Call Interposition Without Compromise](../files/2024-lazypoline.pdf)" has been accepted at DSN 2024! Here, you can check our library and artifact, [lazypoline](https://github.com/lazypoline).

  * I had the privilege of speaking at FOSDEM 2024. You can find my talk is [here](https://fosdem.org/2024/schedule/event/fosdem-2024-2632-friend-or-foe-inside-exploring-in-process-isolation-to-maintain-memory-safety-for-unsafe-rust/)


2023

  * Our research paper, [Friend or Foe Inside? Exploring In-Process Isolation to Maintain Memory Safety for Unsafe Rust](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08127.pdf) preprint is available, and it was accepted at [IEEE Sec-Dev-2023 conference](https://secdev.ieee.org/2023/home). 

  * I will be presenting my work "Rewind & Discard: Improving Software Resilience using Isolated Domain" at [IEEE DSN 2023](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/). The technical report is available at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03205.pdf). The source code is available at [here](https://secure-rewind-and-discard.github.io/) *#softwareresillence*

  * I will be presenting my work "[Exploring the Environmental Benefits of In-Process Isolation for Software Resilience](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02131.pdf)", at [IEEE DSN 2023](https://dsn2023.dei.uc.pt/) in June, 2023. The arxiv version is available at [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02131.pdf) 

  * [The Climate Crisis is a Digital Rights Crisis: Exploring the Civil-Society Framing of Two Intersecting Disasters](https://limits.pubpub.org/pub/8544yai8/release/1) is out. 

  * I am a publicity chair of [SILM workshop](https://silm-workshop.github.io/). Please check the [call of paper](https://silm-workshop.github.io/cfp/)! 

  * I joined [PrivacyCamp, 2023](https://privacycamp.eu/workshop-the-climate-crisis-is-a-key-digital-rights-issue/). So nice experience!

2022

  * I stayed for one week at Graz University [Summer School: SECURITY, PRIVACY & CORRECTNESS IN THE IOT, 2022, Graz University](https://securityweek.at/2022/). Highly recommended!! 
  
  * I attended the Summer School on Security Testing and Verification at KU Leuven. I did a poster presentation there; please check out [here](../files/SDROB_Poster-E-5CG2171BCR.pdf) 
Â  * ["Unlimited Lives: Secure In-Process Rollback with Isolated Domains"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03205.pdf) is out! 
  * I got the IEEE Comsoc Turkey Master Thesis Award; you can find my thesis [here](../files/master_thesis)
