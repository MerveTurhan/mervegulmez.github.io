I am a security researcher at Ericsson and PhD Student at KU Leuven. 

I am a part of [5GhOST](https://5ghosts.eu/) project funded by the EU involving [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/kuleuven/) and [Ericsson](https://www.ericsson.com/en). 

I have been studying the strong isolation mechanism nowadays. 

Here is the first result of my work

["Unlimited Lives: Secure In-Process Rollback with Isolated Domains"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.03205.pdf)

Feel free to reach for any feedback!
