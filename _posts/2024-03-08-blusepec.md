To install the [BSC compiler](https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/releases), follow these steps (example for Ubuntu):
 
 
Example for Ubuntu 
```bash
wget https://github.com/B-Lang-org/bsc/releases/download/2023.07/bsc-2023.07-ubuntu-22.04.tar.gz 
cd ~/cheri/bsc-2023.07-debian-12.1 
export PATH="$PATH:/home/cheri/bsc-2023.07-ubuntu-22.04/bin/
```
