I worked on macro expansion on Rust for that project: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.08127

Here are some commands that help debug Rust macro expansions. 

```c
cargo rustc --bin mybin -- -Z trace-macros // build with macro expansion 
rust-gdb -q ./target/debug/sdrob_rust // rust gdb for debugging 
cargo rustc --bin mybin --profile=check -- -Zunpretty=expanded 
```

And a good reference: Rust macro book!Â
