CHERI
======

Adversarial Examples: A great starting point!  These exercises will introduce you to the concept of capabilities and how they can be used to protect against various security threats.

## Troubleshooting 
1)  Mounting a Folder to QEMU: 
    It is needed when you do cross-compiling! You can check [this commit](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheri-exercises/pull/26/commits/693140f74f0fc523caee3f3836834fc86608303d)

  Simply run in qemu: 



```bash
mount_smbfs -I 10.0.2.4 -N //10.0.2.4/source_root /mnt
```

2) If running `~/cheri/cheribuild/cheribuild.py run-riscv64-purecap -d` results in an error indicating that the -lsbuf library cannot be found, unset your SYSROOT. 

You can use this script `https://ctsrd-cheri.github.io/cheri-exercises/introduction/ccc.html`. This script simplifies the compilation process for CHERI. You don't need to set SYSROOT, or the others. 
```bash
ccc riscv64-purecap print-pointer.c -o printpointer`
```

3) How you connect to running qemu? 
  You can connect running qemu via ssh, find its IP address and port. 

```bash
ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p portnumber
```
