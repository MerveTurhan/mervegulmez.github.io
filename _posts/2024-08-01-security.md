At the beginning of my PhD I at first became interested in the broader area of cybersecurity, but my current line of research really got me into the area of systems security. In particular improving the cyber-resilience and availability low-level systems software against memory corruption attacks. This has required me to develop skills, such as in-depth knowledge of the C and Rust runtimes, as well as assembly programming.

I want to put some notes here shows that what I read during my journey
